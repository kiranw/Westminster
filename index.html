				<p>We were struck by Lamport's Paxos and Byzantine Generals Problem papers. In both of these, Lamport relates
					a system design to a human analogy to explain how such a system would look in a mechanism that is relatable.
					However, what if the inverse approach was applied to designing a system? In this project, we attempt to extract
					parts of the Westminster System to create a distributed, hierarchical conensus and leader election algorithm.
				</p>
				<p>Whether human analogies incept the ideas, or the ideas beget analogies we were interested to see what
					could be gained from applying human systems to distributed systems. It is clear that there are
					striking parallels between the design of distributed systems and the construction of government
					systems. Consensus and leader election are long standing requirements of many governments today.
				</p>
				<p>We start with the Westminster System since it has several requirements that are clearly structured, and
					the system operates almost like an interface that has been extended and customized by several other
					governments for various purposes (a lot of the Eastern Bloc, India, Australia, Canada, Japan).

				<li>Cannot prevent bills from being passed into law, but can force the Commons to reconsider votes and delay a process</li>

			</ul>

			<strong class="sub-heading">Monarch</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Makes appointments based on the advice of the House and Prime Minister</li>
				<li>Terms are lifelong and hereditary</li>
				<li>There is no election</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">Prime Minister</strong><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Selects a cabinet of advisors</li>
				<li>Appointed by the Monarch as a person with the confidence of the House of Commons</li>
				<li>"Primus inter pares": First among equals</li>
				<li>Can be forced to resign if they lose a vote of confidence</li>
				<li>Terms are "at her majesty's pleasure"</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<p>This is an extremely reductive representation of only parts of the Parliament system. There is also a judiciary system which
				we will not be exploring in this project, because revision and review of a corpus of data that has already been agreed upon
				occurs in the Parliament in our model system.</p>

			<p>It is worth highlighting a few key characteristics we want to embrace, and others we will not be including in the project.
				The House of Commons serves a shorter cycle than the House of Lords, which allows for staggered voting and different leases.
				This means the House of Lords can best represent local changes to a network if machines are added and dropped - this form
				of representation will be most responsive. However, choosing the representatives of a large scale system that often may
				delay the speed of decision making. This makes the bicameral structure ideal, where the House of Lords is less responsive
				but more stable over time.</p>

			<p>Although the term limits are worth integrating into the system, we did not include the proportion of each
				as it currently exists in the Parliament. The House of Lords in reality is larger than the House of Commons,
				but in this system, but House of Lords will be significantly smaller.</p>

			<p>Apart from the federated model of decision making, we will also be including votes of confidence. These will be regularly
				initiated, and can serve to either terminate or renew the lease of a serving prime minister, which, in this case, is automatically
				enduring unless a Vote of No Confidence occurs.</p>

			<p> Lastly, a Monarch will not be included in this system. In our use case of the Westminster System as a distributed system, it is
			difficult to imagine a system in which any machine is as permanent as a Monarch, that is not selected or renewed by consensus.</p>

			<br>
			<strong class="sub-heading">Assumptions about the Underlying System Structure</strong><br><br>
			<strong>Network Structure</strong><br>
			<p>We assume a network in which there are geographically distributed machines across a broad scale. If not
				geographically distributed, this system is modelled after machines that represent diverse services,
				products or operations such that inclusion of different "districts" or zones is important. In this way,
				the use of constituencies to partition the network into smaller districts for hierarchical voting makes sense.
				If some decisions to be made are localized to specific districts, then a vote can occur internally, without
				continuing to deeper levels of the hierarchy before reaching an answer. This can improve efficiency and availability
				in the larger system, and better utilize the local system.</p>

			<p>Such an assumption requires tools to partition networks. Several algorithms already exist that use different
				heuristics to separate topologies into smaller clusters which we will consider to be districts: __, __, __.
				The specific algorithm remains a choice to the implementer of the system, as it should be chosen to best
				represent the needs of user.</p>


			<strong>Commodity Machines</strong><br>
			<p>We assume the system is composed of several commodity machines. This practically makes sense, as large
			scale distributed systems do not depend on reliable machines to construct reliable systems. In this system design,
			we handle the addition or removal of machines with shorter leases for local leader terms. This allows
			for local leader elections to be more responsive to changes in local districts. Machines also maintain reputations
			which are based on some heuristic. Machines that have proven more "trustworthiness" score higher reputation
			metrics, which are used to appoint machines to higher serving positions and carry more voting power.</p>

			<strong>Operations Expected</strong><br>
			<p>This system can support local leader election (Commons), the selection of the next layer (Lords), global leader
			election (PM), and standard CRUD operations. Some operations can be handled locally, for example, reads or
			writes for local districts that do not need consensus among the entire system (could be useful for temporary logs).</p>

			In this visualization, we present a local district voting system. The system starts with Node 0 as its
			elected local leader. The first panel (center) represents the scoring metrics updating, establishing a reputation
			on the machines. The top scoring machine is offered a ballot position in the next election, and the current
			leader will broadcast to all nodes in the district that an election is occuring. Constituent nodes must
			respond within a fixed amount of time for their vote to count, and the leader announces the newly elected leader
			by broadcasting to all nodes. A log of the internal system actions is maintained on the right side.
